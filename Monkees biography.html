<p>The Monkees are an American rock band. They have been originally active between 1965 and 1971. 
They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider. The band consists of 4 members,
Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and singer Davy Jones.
For the first few months the four actor-musicians were allowed only limited roles in the recording studio.
This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series. 
Nesmith has been composing and producing some songs from the beginningand Peter Tork contributed limited guitar
work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. They eventually fought for and earned the right to collectively supervise 
all musical output under the band's name.

<p>Tork was born at the former Doctors Hospital, in Washington, D.C.[2] Although he was born in the District of Columbia
 in 1942,[3] many news articles incorrectly report him as born in 1944 in New York City, which was the date and place 
 given on early Monkees press releases. He is the son of Virginia Hope (née Straus) and Halsten John Thorkelson, an 
 economics professor at the University of Connecticut.[4][5] His paternal grandfather was of Norwegian descent, while his
 mother was of half German Jewish and half British Isles ancestry.[6][7][8][9] He began studying piano at the age of nine,
 showing an aptitude for music by learning to play several different instruments, including the banjo and both acoustic bass
 and guitars. Tork attended Windham High School in Willimantic, Connecticut, and was a member of the first graduating class
 at E.O. Smith High School in Storrs, Connecticut. He attended Carleton College before he moved to New York City, where he
 became part of the folk music scene in Greenwich Village during the first half of the 1960s. While there, he befriended
 other up-and-coming musicians such as Stephen Stills.</p>
